What the Code Does: This assembly code creates a simple calculator program that can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
How It Works:
Displaying the Menu:


The program starts by displaying a menu with four options: Add, Multiply, Subtract, and Divide.
The user is prompted to select an option by pressing the corresponding number key.
Inputting Numbers:


Once an option is selected, the program asks the user to input two numbers.
The input is taken digit by digit, and each digit is stored in the stack.
The digits are then combined to form the complete number.
Performing the Operation:


Based on the user's choice, the program performs the selected operation on the two input numbers.
The result of the operation is stored in a register.
Displaying the Result:


The program displays the calculated result on the screen, digit by digit.
Key Components and Their Functions:
msg, msg2, msg3, msg4, msg5, msg6: These are message strings that are displayed to the user.
start: This label marks the beginning of the main program execution.
InputNo: This procedure takes input from the user, digit by digit, and stores it in the stack.
FormNo: This procedure combines the digits from the stack to form a complete number.
View: This procedure displays the result on the screen, digit by digit.
ViewNo: This procedure displays a single digit on the screen.
Addition, Multiply, Subtract, Divide: These procedures perform the respective arithmetic operations on the input numbers and display the result.
In essence, the code follows these steps:
Display the menu.
Get user input.
Perform the selected operation.
Display the result.
